I made CLI Rewire so that I could take multiple CLIs (eslint, webpack, babel, jest, etc.) and combine them into a single tool, rewired to my preferences.

This library can be used to make something similar to [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) or [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts).

Check out [my other project](https://github.com/jr-codes/u) for an example on how to use this library.
